# Sai's Sheets
![SS](https://github.com/JulianBOrtega/SS-Sheets/blob/master/public/ss_banner.png)

A sheet extension made for a custom game of Dungeon World, in owlbear rodeo.

## Features
- Allows players to fill their character sheet and use 2d10 dices (instead of the standard) for stats rolls.
- Equipment management, usage and equip functionalities.
- Bonds.
- Chat window with options for dice rolling, whisper DM and character selection.
- And more coming in the future.

## Note
At this moment, this extension exists only with the purpose of being used for this particular game, and it's only available in spanish.
As much as I wish, I don't have the time to update it frequently and hear other people's requests.
That said, feel free to fork it and do whatever you want with it.
